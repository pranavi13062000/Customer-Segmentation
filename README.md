# Customer-Segmentation


Worked on Customer Segmentation which is a popular application of unsupervised learning. I used the concept of clustering to identify segments of customers to target the potential user base and divided customers into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests, and spending habits so it can be marketed to each group effectively. 
I used K-means clustering and also visualized the gender and age distributions also analyzed their annual incomes and spending scores.
